                <h3>About Me</h3>
                <p>My name is Yan. \(^v^)/</p>
                <p>
                    I always wanted to have a career switch as I really wanted to have more flexibility in my job.
                    Therefore, I started to explore if there were careers outside of my current awareness. And then I found that coding seemed very interesting to me so I also started to play around on Codecademy, Datacamp and Udemy alongside watching some Youtube tutorials. Afterwards, I decided to join a bootcamp course because I was keen to learn more in-depth with guidance and keep myself accountable. My short term goal is to enhance my coding skills and knowledge and hopefully I can be a developer working in the tech industry.
